# Web Applications ðŸ“š

A collection of smallâ€“toâ€“medium-sized web apps Iâ€™ve built to practice modern stacks and to showcase in my rÃ©sumÃ©.  
Every project lives in its own sub-directory so you can browse or run them independently.

| Folder | Stack | What it is |
|--------|-------|------------|
| **NotesManager** | PostgreSQL Â· Go (Gin) Â· React (Vite) | A full-stack note-taking service with lists, JWT auth and Dockerised dev/prod workflow |

## Running a project

git clone github.com/berezovskiydeval/web-applications.git
cd web-applications

# each project has its own README
cd NotesManager
docker compose up           # example â€“ spins up db, backend & frontend
